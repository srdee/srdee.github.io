# Introduction

My name is **Stella Rose Dee**. I grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. As an undergrad I studied archaeobotany and I have a masters of forestry. For the last five years I've been a practicing climbing arborist; this year I'm the ISA women's tree climbing champion of New England! I live with my three year old daughter, a wonderful partner, a cat and seven chickens. I'm a PhD student in *Environmental Conservation (Arboriculture)* interested in the mechanical and physiological effects of arboricultural pruning practices, including somatic memory in plants and the possible ability of pruning to prime for biotic stress.
